#Fram Strait data set

#It is planed to use this data sets for an RDA (Redandancy analyses)
YData=read.csv("C:/Users/rhoffman/Desktop/Ph.D. AWI/Arktis - Fram Strait Expeditionen/All data/R-Statistiken/All_Data/All-Y-removeOutlier.csv", header=T, sep = ";")

#Schedule:
#1.Transformation = z-scoring of both
#Command is
#scale(x, center=T, scale = T )
#Questions:
#Do I have to do this for both- YData and X-Data?
#How to perfom the the scoring?
#     a) For each parameter? --> merging independently from Station and Year
#     b) For each parameter and Station? --> merging independently from Year
#     c) For each parameter and Station and Year, because each of them were sampled independantly?

#     Examples for each perfomance
#     a) scale(YData$DOU, center=T, scale = T )

#2.Outlier identification
#Command is
#outlier()
#Question:
#How to perform the outlier identification?
#     For each parameter? --> outlier identification over all Stations and both Years
#     For each parameter and Station? --> Outlier identification over both Years
#     For each parameter and Station and Year --> Outlier identification for each sampling event

#3.Process outlier with winsorising = changing the value of an outlier to the next highest or lowest value in the data set that is not an outlier
#Question:
#How to do this in R as easy as possible?

#4.Multiple regression model
#I don't have a clue, how to do this

#5.RDA
#I don't have a clue, how to do this


#In the last jam you said that a t-test (hotellings t-squared test) is needed
#how and when (at which step, e.g. before or after z-scoring) should it be done?



#Everything below is producing some boxplots (representing outliers)
#and some subsets
#maybe useful...maybe not
#They are artefacts from a previous and unuseful approache
